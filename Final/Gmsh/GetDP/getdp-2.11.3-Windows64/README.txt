This is GetDP, a General Environment for the Treatment of Discrete Problems.

GetDP is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. See the
LICENSE.txt and CREDITS.txt files for more information.

The demos/ directory contains a simple example. For more examples see the
reference manual (http://getdp.info/doc/texinfo/) and the ONELAB web site
(http://onelab.info).

Notes:
      
* GetDP has no integrated graphical user interface: it is run from the command
  shell (terminal).

* If you are looking for a graphical user interface to GetDP, download Gmsh
  (http://gmsh.info). To launch GetDP via Gmsh, simply open Gmsh, go to the
  solver module and click on the GetDP button. The OneLab web site
  (http://onelab.info) has more info.

* The problem definition files (".pro" files) are regular ASCII text files: you
  can create them with whatever text editor you prefer (Notepad, Wordpad, Emacs,
  etc.).

* For Windows users: if you often use GetDP from the command (DOS) shell, you
  should probably consider installing a more powerful replacement. Amongst the
  many free alternatives, we recommend the rxvt shell in the cygwin environment
  (http://www.cygwin.com), which also provides all the necessary tools to
  compile GetDP.
